# IPv6 Network Diagram

This repository contains my planned IPv6 network topology, created using Miro.  
It includes a hierarchical router structure and IPv6 address planning.

## Subnets Used

- R1 ↔ R2: 2001:1:2:1::/64  
- R2 ↔ R3: 2001:1:2:2::/64  
- R3 ↔ R4: 2001:1:2:3::/64  
- R4: 2001:1:2:4::/64  
- R5: 2001:1:2:5::/64  
- R6: 2001:1:2:6::/64  
- R7: 2001:1:2:7::/64  
- R8: 2001:1:2:8::/64  
- R9: 2001:1:2:9::/64  

Each router is assigned a unique IPv6 subnet using the /64 prefix, following best practices for LAN segmentation.

## Notes

- IPv6 is the future of networking and complements my IPv4 design.  
- This project is part of my journey into modern networking and cybersecurity.  
- Future updates will include routing protocols, firewall rules, and security policies.
