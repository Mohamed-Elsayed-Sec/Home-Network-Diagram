# Home Network Diagram

This repository documents my first network design using diagrams and Linux.  
It includes two versions of the topology: one using IPv4 and another using IPv6.

## Structure

- **IPv4**: Includes subnet planning and hierarchical router setup
- **IPv6**: Includes modern address planning and future routing policies

## Tools Used

- Miro / draw.io for diagramming
- GitHub for documentation
- Linux for simulation and configuration

## Notes

This project is part of my learning journey into networking and cybersecurity.  
Future updates will include routing protocols, firewall rules, and security policies.
